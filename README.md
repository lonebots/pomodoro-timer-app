**Boost productivity with the Pomodoro Timer - a simple and effective technique that uses focused work sessions to achieve more in less time.**

<p style="justify-content: center;">
The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into focused intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, called "pomodoros," separated by short breaks of 3-5 minutes. After completing four pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken. The technique aims to improve productivity and focus by reducing the impact of interruptions, distractions, and fatigue.
